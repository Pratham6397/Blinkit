# Blinkit Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing data from Blinkit to gain insights and evaluate total sales over the 2023-2024 period. The analysis aims to understand user behavior, optimize operations, and improve overall business performance by leveraging data-driven decisions.

## Project Description

The Blinkit Data Analysis project is designed to extract, transform, and analyze data from the Blinkit platform. The primary focus of this analysis is to gain insights into user behavior and evaluate total sales over the 2023-2024 period. By leveraging various data analytics techniques, the project aims to:
- Understand user demographics, preferences, and activities.
- Analyze transaction history to identify purchasing patterns and trends.
- Evaluate operational metrics related to inventory, logistics, and order fulfillment.
- Identify key factors influencing sales performance and overall business growth.

The insights gained from this analysis will inform strategic decisions to optimize operations, enhance user experience, and drive business performance improvements. Through data-driven decision-making, the project seeks to support Blinkit's goal of providing a seamless and satisfying shopping experience for its users.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is the Blinkit dataset from Kaggle. It includes:
- **User Data**: Demographics, preferences, activities and Reviews.
- **Transaction Data**: Purchases, returns, and financial transactions.
- **Operational Data**: Inventory, logistics, and order fulfillment metrics.

The dataset is cleaned and analyzed to gain valuable insights and improve business performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the Blinkit Data Analysis project. During this phase, the dataset is thoroughly examined to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses. Here are the main tasks involved in the EDA process:

1. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them.
2. **Summary Statistics**: Calculate key statistics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and interquartile range to summarize the central tendency and dispersion of the data.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Examine correlations between variables to identify potential relationships and dependencies. This can help in understanding how different factors influence sales and user behavior.
4. **Missing Values Analysis**: Identify and handle missing data. This may involve imputation, removal of missing values, or other techniques to ensure data integrity.
5. **Outlier Detection**: Detect and address outliers that may skew the analysis. Outliers can be handled by removal, transformation, or other suitable methods.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on existing data that can improve the performance of predictive models. This can include aggregating data, creating interaction terms, or transforming variables.
7. **Data Transformation**: Apply transformations such as scaling, normalization, or encoding to prepare the data for further analysis and modeling.

EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, helping to inform subsequent analysis steps and model development. By gaining insights into the data through EDA, the project can better address business questions and drive data-driven decisions.

## Statistical Analysis

In the Blinkit Data Analysis project, we:
1. **Describe Data**: Look at averages and ranges.
2. **Test Ideas**: Compare averages and check connections.
3. **Find Relationships**: Use regression to see how things relate.
4. **Check Connections**: Measure how things are linked.
5. **Look at Time Trends**: Analyze patterns over time.
6. **Group Data**: Organize similar data into groups.
7. **Study Multiple Factors**: Understand how different things interact.

These steps help us make sense of the data and improve business decisions.


## DAX Measures

In this project, we have used several DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures to perform custom calculations in our data analysis. Below are some of the key DAX measures used:

These measures help in understanding overall sales performance, user behavior, and growth trends over time.


## Results Documentation

In the Blinkit Data Analysis project, documenting the results is crucial for sharing insights and supporting data-driven decisions. Here's how we handle the results documentation:

- **Data Visualizations and Summary Reports**: Create clear visualizations (graphs, charts) and detailed reports to represent findings and summarize key insights.
